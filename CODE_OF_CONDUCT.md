# Solar_Power_Application Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
As contributors, leaders, and members of the Solar_Power_Application community, we pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of factors such as age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, experience level, education, socio-economic status, nationality, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

We commit to contributing to a welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community for all.

## Our Standards
- Showing empathy and kindness to others
- Being respectful of differing opinions and experiences
- Giving and accepting constructive feedback gracefully
- Taking responsibility for our actions, apologizing when needed, and learning from mistakes
- Prioritizing the collective good of the community over individual interests

**Unacceptable behavior includes:**
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, or sexual attention of any kind
- Trolling, insulting remarks, or personal/political attacks
- Harassment, whether public or private
- Sharing private information (such as contact details) without consent
- Any behavior that could be considered inappropriate in a professional environment

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Community leaders are responsible for upholding these standards and will take appropriate actions in response to any unacceptable behavior. They have the authority to edit, remove, or reject comments, commits, or other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. Leaders will provide explanations for their moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies in all community spaces, as well as in public representations of the Solar_Power_Application community (e.g., via official email addresses or social media accounts).

## Enforcement
Reports of unacceptable behavior can be made to the community leaders at [agarwalharsh6583@gmail.com](mailto:agarwalharsh6583@gmail.com). All complaints will be reviewed and responded to fairly and promptly. Leaders are expected to maintain the privacy and security of reporters.

## Enforcement Guidelines
1. **Correction:** For minor infractions, a private warning will be issued, clarifying the nature of the violation and why it is inappropriate.
2. **Warning:** For repeated or more significant violations, a warning will be given with specified consequences for continued behavior. Further interaction with those involved may be restricted for a set period.
3. **Temporary Ban:** For serious violations, a temporary ban from the community will be enforced, disallowing any interaction with the community during this period.
4. **Permanent Ban:** For continuous or egregious behavior, a permanent ban from the community will be enforced.
